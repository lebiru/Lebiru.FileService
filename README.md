- **Multi-File Download to Zip**: Users can download multiple files into a zip from the server. (@alfcanres)
- **File Listing**: Users can view a list of uploaded files along with their upload times.
- **Image Preview**: üñºÔ∏è Image files are displayed with a preview in the web interface.
- **Text File Preview**: üìÑ Text files show the first 100 characters as a preview in the web interface.
- **File Expiry**: ‚è≥ Set expiration times for uploaded files (1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or never).
- **Background Jobs**: üîÑ Automated cleanup of expired files using Hangfire.
- **Job Monitoring**: üìä Hangfire dashboard for monitoring file cleanup and expiry jobs.
- **Console Logging**: üìù Detailed logging of file deletions and cleanup operations.
- **Dark Mode**: üåô Toggle between light and dark themes for better visibility.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. **Open the solution** in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. **Build the solution** to restore dependencies.
4. **Run the application** using the IDE's built-in tools or command-line interface.
5. **Access the application** through the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:port`).

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite. To run the tests and generate a coverage report:

1. Run the tests with coverage:
```powershell
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

2. Generate an HTML report (replace the coverage GUID with your actual generated GUID):
```powershell
cd Lebiru.FileService.Tests
reportgenerator -reports:"TestResults\{guid}\coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coveragereport" -reporttypes:Html
```

The HTML report will be generated in the `Lebiru.FileService.Tests\coveragereport` directory. Open `index.html` in your browser to view a detailed breakdown of code coverage across the project.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available through Swagger. Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI by navigating to `/swagger` in your browser.

## Usage

### Authentication and Users

- The application requires authentication for all features
- Three user roles are available:
  - **Admin**: Full access to all features including user management
  - **Contributor**: Can upload and manage files
  - **Viewer**: Can view and download files
- Default users are created at first startup with generated passwords:
  - `admin` (Admin role)
  - `contributor` (Contributor role)
  - `viewer` (Viewer role)
- Passwords are displayed in the console at first startup
- All API endpoints and web interfaces require authentication
- Current user is displayed in the navigation bar

### File Operations

- **Uploading Files**: 
  - Use the web interface or send a POST request to `/File/CreateDoc` with the file attached as form data
  - Set expiry time during upload (1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week, or never)
  - Files are automatically deleted when they expire
  - Files are associated with the uploading user
- **Downloading Files**: 
  - Click the download link in the web interface or send a GET request to `/File/DownloadFile?filename=your_file_name`
  - Batch download multiple files as a ZIP archive
  - Downloads are tracked in API metrics
- **Printing Files**:
  - Use the Print button in the file actions menu to open the browser's print dialog
  - Optimized print layout for different file types (images, PDFs, text)
  - Print directly from the application without downloading files first
- **Renaming Files**:
  - Click the Rename button in the file actions menu to rename files
  - File extension is automatically preserved to maintain file type
  - Only file owners and admins can rename files
  - All references to the file are updated automatically (ownership records, file metadata)
- **Copying Files**:
  - Use the Make Copy button in the file actions menu to duplicate files
  - Automatically appends " Copy" to the filename (or " Copy N" if needed for uniqueness)
  - Creates a new file with same content and attributes as the original
  - New copy is assigned to the user who created it
  - File references are automatically updated (ownership records, file metadata)
- **File Management**:
  - View list of all uploaded files with upload times and expiry status
  - Rename files while preserving file extension and ownership
  - See remaining time before file expiry
  - Automatic cleanup of expired files
  - Monitor file operations through Hangfire dashboard at `/hangfire`
  - "Delete All Files" feature for admins with proper cleanup of all related data
- **User Interface**:
  - Image previews for supported formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP)
  - Click previews to view full-size images
  - Toggle dark mode for comfortable viewing
  - Search and filter files
  - Sort files by various criteria (name, size, upload time, expiry)
